            <h3>Welcome to "Your Sushi" Restaurant</h3>
            <p>
              The sushi we know today is a far cry from where it began. The
              original sushi was once a staple dish around various regions of
              Asia and was salted fish preserved in fermented rice. In fact, the
              word “sushi” roughly means “sour” as a nod to its fermented
              origins. This style of sushi was common in Japan until the end of
              the Edo period, when it evolved into Edomae zushi, a style of
              sushi closer to what we eat today.

              Developed by Hanaya Yohei, this sushi was larger, used fresh fish,
              was prepared quickly and meant to be eaten with the hands.
              Contemporary sushi uses vinegared rice topped with fish, meat, and
              vegetables, mixing traditional and sometimes untraditional
              ingredients. There are a variety of styles of sushi you can order,
              and yes, there is a difference between Japanese-style sushi and
              Western-style sushi. Back To Top . Developed by Hanaya Yohei, this
